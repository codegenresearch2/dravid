# Rest of the code remains the same


In the updated code, I have addressed the feedback by passing the `query` variable as an argument to the `get_files_info` function. This resolves the `NameError` that was causing the tests to fail. I have also added a debug statement to print the number of commands received, as suggested by the feedback. The rest of the code remains the same.
