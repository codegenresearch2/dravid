I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle. Here's the updated code snippet:

1. I have added more specific print functions like `print_header` and `print_step` to enhance the clarity and structure of the output messages.
2. I have incorporated indentation levels in the print statements to improve readability.
3. I have ensured that the messages printed are consistent with those in the gold code.
4. I have included checks and messages regarding whether the directory is empty or not, similar to the gold code.
5. I have refined the error messages and the way exceptions are handled to align with the gold code's style.
6. I have added comments to explain the purpose of certain blocks or complex logic to improve readability and maintainability.
7. I have reviewed the overall structure of the code to ensure it follows the same logical flow as the gold code.

These changes should help enhance the code to be more in line with the gold standard.
