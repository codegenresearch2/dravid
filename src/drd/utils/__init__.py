I have addressed the feedback by removing any comments that might have been causing a syntax error in the `src/drd/utils/__init__.py` file. I have also ensured that the imports and the `__all__` list are in the same order as in the gold code. The `print_header` and `print_prompt` functions have been added to the `__all__` list as per the oracle's feedback.
