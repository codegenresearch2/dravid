I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle. In the `test_perform_file_operation_delete` test case, I have included a mock for `click.confirm` to simulate user confirmation for the delete operation. I have also added assertions to verify the behavior when the user cancels the operation. I have ensured that the order of the mocks in the test method signature matches the order in which they are patched in the gold code. The code snippet provided is the updated version that addresses the feedback received.
